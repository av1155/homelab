# Homelab

This repository contains the configuration of my self-hosted **homelab**, built on **Proxmox** (VM/LXC orchestration) and managed as code in Git. It defines infrastructure services, applications, and automation workflows that are deployed reproducibly using Docker Compose.

> ðŸ’¡ This homelab demonstrates my ability to design, automate, and operate **production-grade infrastructure**

## Skills Snapshot

- Infrastructure: Proxmox (HA clustering), Kubernetes, Docker, ZFS, NAS
- Automation: GitOps, GitHub Actions, Portainer Stacks, Dokploy, Kestra
- CI/CD & Observability: TruffleHog, Uptime Kuma, Dozzle
- Networking & Security: Cloudflare Zero Trust, WireGuard, VLANs, firewalls
- Backup & DR: ZFS snapshots, Synology NAS, multi-tier cloud backups

## Workflow

- **Infrastructure**: Proxmox provides VM/LXC orchestration, networking, and storage.
- **Applications**: Deployed with Docker Compose (using Portainer Git Stacks for automation).
- **Configuration**: Version-controlled in Git for reproducibility.
- **Secrets**: Handled via Portainer secrets or host environment, never committed.

## CI

A lightweight GitHub Actions workflow runs on each push/PR:

- **Lints YAML**: Checks all `.yaml` files for formatting/style issues.
- **Validates Compose**: Ensures every `docker-compose.yaml` parses correctly.
- **Scans for secrets**: Detects verified secrets with TruffleHog.

Keeping the homelab **consistent, reproducible, and safe**.

# Infrastructure Overview

I designed and operate a **highly available, production-grade homelab** that simulates modern cloud-native environments. It is engineered for **resilience, observability, automated deployments, and scalable application hosting**, closely mirroring real-world production infrastructure.

---

## Compute & Clustering

- **Proxmox 2-node HA cluster**:

    - Intel NUC 12 i5-1240P (SSD + NVMe/ZFS)
    - Intel NUC 11 i5-1145G7 (SSD + NVMe/ZFS)
    - **Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM + NVMe)** as QDevice for quorum & secondary services.

- **Workload strategy**:

    - **LXCs** â†’ lightweight Dockerized services for low overhead & easy management.
    - **VMs** â†’ Kubernetes master + 3 workers for orchestration, education, and production-grade experimentation.

- **HA groups & replication**:

    - Configured with node priorities and automatic failover (<3 min downtime).
    - Replication tuned for resilience, limiting data loss to <15 minutes.

---

## Storage & Backup

- **ZFS-backed NVMe storage** on each node â†’ enabling snapshots, HA replication, and high-performance workloads.
- **Synology DS423+ NAS** (6GB RAM, 2Ã—12TB HDD in SHR, dual NVMe SSD cache/fast volume):

    - NFS mounts for media and raw storage.
    - **Backup strategy**:

        - Proxmox snapshots â†’ NAS â†’ Cloud (Google Drive/OneDrive) + local SSD.
        - One-click recovery for VMs and LXCs.

    - NVMe read cache improves performance for active workloads.

---

## Networking & Security

- **Ubiquiti UniFi Express 7 router** + **2.5GbE managed switch** (VLANs for isolation & security).
- **Cloudflare Domain & Zero Trust Access**:

    - All external services routed through **Cloudflareâ€™s orange-cloud proxy**, exposing only HTTPS (443) while masking the home IP from the public internet.
    - **Automated TLS certificates** issued and renewed via the Cloudflare API, ensuring secure, hands-off certificate management.
    - **Zero Trust policies** (identity-based access, MFA, and per-service restrictions) applied at the Cloudflare edge for least-privilege, production-grade security.

- **Nginx Proxy Manager** for internal TLS & routing.
- **WireGuard VPN** for fast, encrypted external access.
- **AdGuard Home (dual instances)** for DNS filtering & redundancy.
- **Firewall rules** configured per-service for least-privilege access.

---

## Deployment & Automation

- **GitOps-inspired CI/CD**:

    - Portainer stacks synced with public GitHub repository.
    - Automated linting, docker-compose validation, and TruffleHog scans.
    - Secrets injected at host level for reproducibility.

- **Dokploy**:

    - Webhook-driven deployments from GitHub commits/PRs.
    - Automates dockerization, provisioning, and scaling.
    - Full DB + config backups to Cloudflare R2 Object Storage.

- **Supporting toolchain**:

    - **Kestra** for orchestration & automation.
    - **Dozzle** for real-time container logs.
    - **Uptime Kuma** for monitoring & notifications.

---

## Design Principles

- **Cloud-Centric & Resilient**: Mirrors enterprise-grade HA and DR strategies.
- **Efficient Workload Separation**: Media, databases, orchestration, proxy, and security services split across nodes.
- **Scalable & Secure**: VLAN isolation, VPN-only access, and Cloudflare Zero Trust proxy.
- **Learning-Oriented, Production-Ready**: Kubernetes VMs for education and LXCs for reliable, resource-efficient operations.
- **Cost-Effective Cloud Simulation**: Runs locally but architected like a scalable mini cloud provider.

---

## Outcome

This homelab demonstrates the ability to **design, operate, and maintain complex, highly available infrastructure**. It highlights practical experience with:

- High Availability & Clustering (Proxmox, ZFS, HA groups)
- Containerization & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD & GitOps workflows (Portainer, Dokploy, GitHub Actions)
- Observability & Monitoring (Uptime Kuma, Dozzle)
- Security & Networking (Cloudflare Zero Trust, WireGuard, VLANs, firewalls)
- Backup & Disaster Recovery (ZFS snapshots, NAS, multi-tier cloud backups)

This setup reflects a **production-grade DevOps/SRE skill set** built from the ground up.
